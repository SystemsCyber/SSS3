# SSS3
The code base for the Teensy 3.6 based Smart Sensor Simulator 3. This SSS3 is primarily designed to simulate sensors for heavy vehicle electronic control units; however, it can be used for many other things. It is a multitool for vehicle systems. It can be used in a forensic context to simulate the presence of a vehicle and reduce the number of fault codes present when turning on the system again.
